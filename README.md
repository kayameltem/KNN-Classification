# KNN-Classification
The project consists of 2 parts. In the first part, a nearest neighbor algorithm is implemented to classify glass types of different glass. In the second part, a nearest neighbor algorithm is implemented to estimate strength rate values of different concrete materials.Both parts include weighted/unweighted KNN. Datasets are provided.
